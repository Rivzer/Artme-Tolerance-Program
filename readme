# Artme Tolerance Programs

This project was developed by **Kyano** as part for [Artme3D]. The program is designed to measure and track the tolerance of filament rolls used in filament extruders. It allows users to measure filament diameters, generate QR codes for each roll, and review the measurement history by scanning the QR codes.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Filament Measurements**: Measure and analyze the diameter of filaments to ensure quality.
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports Dutch, English, and German for a global user base.
- **QR Code Generation**: Generate QR codes for filament spools to easily track their history.
- **User-friendly Interface**: An intuitive and easy-to-use interface designed for seamless operation.

## Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: EJS, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: None (Local storage)
- **Other Tools**:
  - Chart.js for visualizing measurement data.
  - QR-image for generating QR codes.

## Installation on Raspberry Pi üöÄ

Follow these steps to set up the project on a Raspberry Pi:

### Prerequisites

1. **Raspberry Pi**: Ensure your Raspberry Pi is running Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian).
2. **Node.js**: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your Raspberry Pi.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal on your linux machine.
2. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/Rivzer/Artme-Tolerance-Program.git
    cd Artme-Tolerance-Program
3. Set Up Environment Variables
    sudo apt update
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    npm install

    nano .env
        PORT=80
        QR_BASE_URL=http://localhost
        ADMIN_PASSWORD=69420
4. Start
    node server.js 
    <!-- Voeg nog een service file toe anders -->

### How to use
    On the localhost dashboard you can login with the password thats set in the .env file
    You can check and print qr codes on example: localhost/qr/PLA/001 (localhost/qr/Material name/Spool nr)
    Check that spool info at example: localhost/material/PLA/001
